Dear Students,

in the sessions on September 17 and 19, I showed several demonstrations. Here is a brief guide through these demos, so you can try this at home as well!

Have fun!

# Demo 1: Information in Computer Science

File: img.jpg

This is a picture of Walensee (obviously, you can use any picture for this demo though). I used it to illustrate how individual pixels (and, thus, pictures and picture sequences (i.e., movies)) are stored on a computer. To illustrate, I opened this picture with a text editor as well as with a hex editor (the program "HxD").


# Demo 2: Python and C++

Files: calculate_pi.cpp and calculate_pi.py

I used this demo to illustrate some differences between compiled and interpreted programming languages. Both programs compute the number PI using Leibniz' formula. If you play with the number of terms (to modify the accuracy of this computation) and run the programs (where the .cpp-file needs to be compiled first, see the lecture), you will be able to reproduce the effects I was demonstrating.


# Demo 3: PotionPup

File: PotionPup.sb3

This is a scratch sketch with a little game to illustrate some basic programming/algorithm concepts.


# Demo 4: FirstSteps

File: first_steps.py

This is the result of our quick python crash course.
